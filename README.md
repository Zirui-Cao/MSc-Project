# AutoDiDatta

AutoDiDatta (ADD) is a Python library of self-supervised learning methods for unsupervised representation learning, powered by the Keras API and Tensorflow 2. The main goal of this library is to provide a set of high-quality implementations of SOTA self-supervised learning methods. 

ADD implements some of the most popular self-supervised learning methods, including
